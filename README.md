The PyCitySchools2 Script was written to analyze District Wide reading and math standardized test scores. This script was used to analyze District Wide Data and individual school data, and can be used to make comparisons based on school size, school type, and school funding.The script can be used to analyze the following District Wide data:
  - Total Schools in the District
  - Total Students in the District
  - Total Budget
  - Average Math Score (District Wide)
  - Average Reading Score (District Wide)
  - Percent of Students Passing Math (>69%)
  - Percent of Students Passing Reading (>69%)
  - Percent of Students Passing BOTH Math and Reading 

Using a groupby method, the script looks at school level data such as:
  - School Type (District or Charter)
  - Total Students
  - Total School Budget
  - Per Student Budget
  - Average Math Score Overall
  - Average Reading Score Overall
  - Percent of Students Passing Math (>69%)
  - Percent of Students Passing Reading (>69%)
  - Percent of Students Passing BOTH Math and Reading
  - Average Math Score by Grade
  - Average Reading Score by Grade

Other possibilities with this script include using bins to sort the District Wide data by school size, school type, school spending, and it can provide rankings of the top five and bottom five performing schools in the district.
